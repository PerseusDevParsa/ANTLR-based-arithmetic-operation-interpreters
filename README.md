# ANTLR-based-arithmetic-operation-interpreters
I'm only doing this for extra marks on my Compiler Design course (^v^)
So what this file contains is my several attempts at making an intrepreter for arithmetic operations using ANTLR.
The final product is the file called "CP(Definitely Final)".
but if you want the project with graphics then the file you're looking for is called "project" but be warned that the grammar is quite faulty so although you can run it it may not give you the correct output so if you viewed it and found out the mistake please keep me posted and let me know what i did wrong.
To run the project all you need to do is go to the directory of the project of your choosing and open the CMD from there and enter the following command:
java -cp .;antlr-4.13.1-complete.jar Main input.txt
